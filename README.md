Hello there ðŸ‘‹

# About me

I am a 17 year old Java Developer from England, currently studying Computer Science and doing freelancing work for small businesses and Minecraft servers.
I have always been interested in how computer languages are used to make such brilliant things, I first started doing configuration work for several servers which gave me access to some brilliant Developers who thought me the power of coding.
