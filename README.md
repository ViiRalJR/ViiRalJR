# About me

I am a 20 year old Java Developer from England, currently studying Computer Science and doing freelancing work for small businesses and Minecraft servers.
I have always been interested in how computer languages are used to make such brilliant things, I first started doing configuration work for several servers which gave me access to some amazing Developers who taught me the power of coding. Since then I have always been fascinated in how things work and how they are made, leading me to the astonishing developement community where I have been able to learn many skill sets.
